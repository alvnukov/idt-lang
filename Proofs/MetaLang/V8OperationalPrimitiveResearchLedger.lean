# Operational primitive research ledger

Authoritative research-plan metadata for the parent-reviewed operational route.
These stages describe research tasks, not manifest proof statuses. Compiling this
file checks its metadata, not the mathematical statements written as strings.
Checked evidence names point to inspected declarations; planned artifacts are
kept separately and never serve as checked evidence. Kernel authority remains in
the cited source theorems under their actual hypotheses.

No entry closes the original Hilbert-carrier or Born obligations, derives full
QM or GR, fixes physical scales, or explains dark matter or dark energy.
